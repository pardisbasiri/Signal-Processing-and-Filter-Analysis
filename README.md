# Signal-Processing-and-Filter-Analysis
Exploring and Analyzing Filters, Impulse Responses, and Audio Signal Transformations in Six Parts:

a) Visualizing Frequency Response: DFT of Moving Average Filter Impulse Response

b) Frequency Response Analysis: DFT Visualization of Moving Average Filter Impulse Response

c) Visualizing Low-Pass Filter Frequency Response: DFT Analysis

d) Analyzing Bandpass Filter Frequency Responses: DFT Visualization

e) Filtering Audio with Convolution: Creating Modified Audio Files

f) Filtering and Modifying Audio Signals Using Convolution
